# Todos (in no particular order)

- Determine what to populate the user with in usersController.js. Speak with Sarah about this.

- Rewrite the seeds file with some basic information.

- Figure out how to create dynamic forms. User driven. How to deal with this in the database/model.

- Determine if Tasting Notes should be shared/viewed by other users or if they should be unique to each user. I think they should be able to be viewed, but not updated or edited.

- Fill out the readme file.

- Make sure that when a user is deleted, all of their notes and entries are deleted as well.

- error currently coming from a lack of an api/books.js
