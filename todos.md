# Todos (in no particular order)

- Determine what to populate the user with in usersController.js

- Rewrite the seeds file with some basic information.

- Figure out how to create dynamic forms. User driven. How to deal with this in the database/model.

- Determine if Tasting Notes should be shared/viewed by other users or if they should be unique to each user. I think they should be able to be viewed, but not updated or edited.
